# electronidex
Machine learning for a mock electronics retailer company in R.

This project contains three completed tasks, where each task was for an assignment from management. Note, the scenarios are meant to be realistic, but are not real.

1) In the first task we visualized and evaluated data, and used a random forest classifier to predict missing results from a market analysis survey conducted by a hired third-party. This survey is meant to help us choose which of two brands to pursue a deeper relationship with - Sony or Acer.

2) In the second task we also visualized and evaluated the data. Then, we used multiple linear regression to predict the sales volume of a new lineup of products, and checked for model adequacy by examining the residuals.

3) In the third task we performed a market basket analysis on the transactions from a startup Electronidex is considering acquiring. We used the Aprior unsupervised learning algorithm to build association rules, filtering out actionable rules from the obvious and inexplicable ones.
